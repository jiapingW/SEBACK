## Logic Analysis:
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the program"),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class which manages the game state and logic"),
    ("board.py", "Contains the Board class which represents the game board"),
    ("piece.py", "Contains the Piece class which represents a game piece"),
    ("player.py", "Contains the Player class which represents a player"),
    ("ai.py", "Contains the AI class which provides AI functionality"),
    ("utils.py", "Contains utility functions for the game")
]
```

## Task list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "board.py",
    "piece.py",
    "player.py",
    "ai.py",

```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'utils.py' module contains utility functions such as 'get_valid_moves(board, player)' which returns a list of valid moves for a player on the board.

The 'config.py' module contains configuration variables such as the size of the game board, the number of pieces per player, etc.
