## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the program"),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class which represents the snake in the game"),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class which represents the food in the game"),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class which controls the game logic and manages the snake and food objects"),
    ("cli.py", "Contains the CLI class which handles the command line interface for the game")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "game.py",
    "cli.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The main entry point of the program is in the 'main.py' file. It initializes the game, starts the command line interface, and handles user input.

The 'snake.py' file contains the Snake class which represents the snake in the game. It has methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check for collisions with the snake's body.

The 'food.py' file contains the Food class which represents the food in the game. It has a method to generate a random position for the food within the game grid.

The 'game.py' file contains the Game class which controls the game logic and manages the snake and food objects. It has methods to update the game state, handle user input, and display the game on the command line interface.

The 'cli.py' file contains the CLI class which handles the command line interface for the game. It uses the curses library to create a text-based interface for the game.

The game follows the classic rules of the snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game grid. The snake grows in length when it eats the food, and the game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

The game state includes the grid size, the current score, the position and direction of the snake, the position of the food, and the game over status.

The command line interface allows the player to control the snake using the arrow keys. The game is displayed in the command line interface using ASCII characters.
