## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the game"),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class which controls the game logic"),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class which represents the snake in the game"),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class which represents the food in the game"),
    ("game_screen.py", "Contains the GameScreen class which handles drawing the game screen"),
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "game_screen.py",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The main entry point for the game is in 'main.py'.

The 'game.py' file contains the Game class which controls the game logic.

The 'snake.py' file contains the Snake class which represents the snake in the game.

The 'food.py' file contains the Food class which represents the food in the game.

The 'game_screen.py' file contains the GameScreen class which handles drawing the game screen.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
We need to clarify how the game is started.
