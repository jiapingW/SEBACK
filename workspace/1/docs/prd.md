## Original Requirements:
create a snake cli game.

## Product Goals:
```python
[
    "Create a snake game",
]
```

## User Stories:
```python
[
    "As a player, I want to be able to control the snake's movement",
    "As a player, I want to see the snake grow longer when it eats food",
    "As a player, I want to see my score increase when the snake eats food",
    "As a player, I want the game to end if the snake hits the wall or its own body",
    "As a player, I want to be able to restart the game after it ends",
]
```

## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a command-line interface (CLI) snake game where the player controls the movement of a snake on a grid. The snake should grow longer and the player's score should increase when the snake eats food. The game should end if the snake hits the wall or its own body. The player should be able to restart the game after it ends.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("The snake should move on a grid", "P0"),
    ("The snake should grow longer when it eats food", "P0"),
    ("The player's score should increase when the snake eats food", "P0"),
    ("The game should end if the snake hits the wall or its own body", "P0"),
    ("The player should be able to restart the game after it ends", "P1"),
]
```
