## Original Requirements:

snake cli game

## Product Goals:
```python
[
    "Create a snake game",
    "Provide a command-line interface",
    "Allow users to control the snake"
]
```

## User Stories:
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to start a new game",
    "As a user, I want to be able to control the snake's movement",
    "As a user, I want to see my score and the game over message",
    "As a user, I want to be able to restart the game after it ends"
]
```

## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a snake game with a command-line interface. Users should be able to start a new game, control the snake's movement, see their score and the game over message, and restart the game after it ends.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("End game when the snake hits the wall or itself", "P0"),
    ("Display the snake and the food on the command line", "P1"),
    ("Allow the snake to move in different directions", "P1"),
    ("Increase the snake's length when it eats the food", "P2"),
    ("Implement a scoring system based on the snake's length", "P2")
]
```

There are no unclear points.
