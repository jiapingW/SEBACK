## Logic Analysis: Provided as a Python list[str, str]. the first is filename, the second is class/method/function should be implemented in this file which require accurate and detailed description. Analyze the dependencies between the files, which work should be done first.

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the game"),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class which represents the snake in the game"),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class which represents the food in the game"),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class which represents the game logic and handles game events")
]
```

## Task list: Provided as Python list[str]. Each str is a filename, the more at the beginning, the more it is a prerequisite dependency, should be done first

```python
[
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "game.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge: Anything that should be public like utils' functions, config's variables details that should make clear first.

```python
"""
No shared knowledge at the moment.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR: Provide as Plain text. Make clear here. For example, don't forget a main entry. don't forget to init 3rd party libs.

There are no unclear points in the requirements.
