## functional requirements
```python
[
    "The game should have a grid-based layout":[
        "Create a grid with a specified number of rows and columns",
        "Display the grid on the command line interface"
    ],
    "The snake should be represented by a specific character on the grid":[
        "Create a snake object with an initial position on the grid",
        "Update the snake's position based on user input",
        "Display the snake on the grid using a specific character"
    ],
    "Food should be randomly placed on the grid for the snake to eat":[
        "Generate random coordinates for the food on the grid",
        "Display the food on the grid using a specific character",
        "Check if the snake's position overlaps with the food's position"
    ],
    "The game should end if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the grid":[
        "Check if the snake's position overlaps with any part of its body",
        "Check if the snake's position is outside the boundaries of the grid"
    ],
    "The score should be displayed on the screen":[
        "Keep track of the number of food items eaten by the snake",
        "Display the score on the screen"
    ]
]
```

## non-functional requirements
```python
[
    "Provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for controlling the snake":[
        "Listen for arrow key inputs from the user",
        "Map the arrow key inputs to snake movement directions",
        "Update the snake's position based on the mapped movement directions"
    ],
    "Ensure smooth and responsive gameplay":[
        "Implement a game loop that updates the game state at regular intervals",
        "Handle user input during the game loop",
        "Ensure that the game loop runs at a consistent frame rate"
    ],
    "Display clear and readable text on the command line interface":[
        "Choose a font and font size that is easy to read",
        "Use appropriate colors for text and background",
        "Ensure that the text is displayed without any visual artifacts"
    ]
]
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirements are clear to me.
